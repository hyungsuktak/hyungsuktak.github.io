I am Hyungsuk (Tak) Tak, an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Institute for Computational and Data Science at the Pennsylvania State University. 

As an astro-statistician, I develop practically motivated data analytic tools to tackle statistical challenges in analyzing astronomical data. In particular, I am actively working on time delay cosmography to infer the current expansion rate of the Universe, called the Hubble constant, where I deal with statistical challenges in modeling stochastic variability of irregularly-spaced time series data and developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to better explore multimodal parameter spaces. I am also interested in measurement-error astronomy, solving issues in high-redshift quasar classification or outlier-robust time series analysis in the presence of measurement error.
