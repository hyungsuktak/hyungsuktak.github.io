I am Hyungsuk (Tak) Tak, an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Institute for Computational and Data Science at the Pennsylvania State University. 

In preparation for the era of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, I have worked closely with astronomers to solve statistically challenging problems in analyzing astronomical data. Specifically, my main research interest is measurement error astronomy, developing practically motivated data analytic tools to overcome an unusual property of astronomical data that always accompany heteroscedastic measurement error. Various statistical challenges arise due to this uniqueness of the astronomical data and I am actively dealing with this issue in astronomical classification and time series data analyses. 

Sending an email is the most effective way to reach out to me.
