I am Hyungsuk (Tak) Tak, an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Institute for Computational and Data Science at the Pennsylvania State University. 

In preparation for the era of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, I have worked closely with astronomers to develop practically motivated data analytic tools to overcome statistical challenges in analyzing astronomical data. Specifically, my main research interest is measurement error astrostatistics, providing data-driven or computational solutions to various statistical challenges that arise due to an unusual property of astronomical data, that is, each observation always accompanies with heteroscedastic measurement error uncertainty. I am actively dealing with this issue in large-scale astronomical object classification and irregularly-spaced time series data analyses.
