I am Hyungsuk Tak, an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and the Institute for Computational and Data Science at Pennsylvania State University.

As an astro-statistician, I develop practically motivated data analytic tools to address statistical challenges in analyzing astronomical data. Specifically, I am actively working on time delay cosmography to infer the current expansion rate of the Universe, known as the Hubble constant. My research also involves tackling statistical challenges in modeling the stochastic variability of irregularly-spaced time series data via continuous-time auto-regressive moving average (CARMA) processes and developing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to better explore multimodal parameter spaces. Additionally, I am interested in reverberation mapping lag estimation, measurement-error astronomy, and outlier-robust inference.
